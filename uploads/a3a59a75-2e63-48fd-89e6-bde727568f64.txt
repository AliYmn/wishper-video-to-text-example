Tory! See, he's swimming away. Come back! He's not coming back. Where are you? Where are you from? Maybe a different dialect. Whoooooo! Dory! Whoooooo! Dory, this is not whale. You're speaking like upset stomach. You should try humpback. No, don't try humpback. Whoooooo! Alright, whew! You actually sound sick. Maybe louder, huh?
