 Okay, maybe only speaks whale. Oh, we need a doll. Oh, boy. What are you doing? I'm sure you speak whale. Can you? Oh, we haven't known what you're saying. Think he's swimming away. Come back. We were who couldn't hear him. Maybe a different dialect. Oh, don't worry. Don't worry. You speak like upset stomach. Maybe I should try humpback. No, don't try humpback. Oh, oh, oh, oh. You actually sound sick. Maybe louder, huh?
